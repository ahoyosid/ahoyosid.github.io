My name is Andrés Hoyos Idrobo and I’m a PhD candidate in the 
[Parietal Team at Inria](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/).  
I’m being co-supervised by 
[Bertrand THIRION](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/bertrand-thirions-page/)
and [Gaël VAROQUAUX](http://gael-varoquaux.info/).

I spend most of my time at 
[Neurospin](http://i2bm.cea.fr/drf/i2bm/Pages/NeuroSpin.aspx), but
occasionally you can find me at 
[Inria Saclay](http://www.msr-inria.fr/researchers/andres-hoyos-idrobo/), where
I'm part of the [medilearn project](http://www.msr-inria.fr/projects/medilearn/).


To get in touch, [send me an email](mailto:{{ site.email }}).


## Research interests ##

I’m broadly interested in machine learning and statistics. 
My research focus on problems which arise while applying machine learning 
techniques to large-scale and high dimensional datasets, for instance 
fMRI data. Part of my research aims to find faster statistical methods for 
large-scale fMRI analysis while increasing their stability and prediction
capability. On the neuroscience side, I’m using machine learning techniques 
for inferring cognitive states encoded in brain activation images (decoding).
